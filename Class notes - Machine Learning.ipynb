    "- growing technology which enables computers to learn from past experiences\n",
    "- AI vs machine learning\n",
    "    - machine learning is subset of AI\n",
    "        - development of algorithms and statistical models that enable learning from past experiences\n",
    "    - definition coined in the 1950s: machine learning enables machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance from experiences and predict things without being explicitly programmed\n",
    "- traditional programming vs machine learning\n",
    "    - traditional programming: data + program -> computer -> output\n",
    "    - machine learning: data + output -> computer -> program\n",
