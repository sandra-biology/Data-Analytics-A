    "    - provides commands for manipulating data stored in the database\n",
    "        - operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, querying data using DML commands\n",
    "    - powerful querying capabilities allow you to filer, sort, group, and join data from different tables to get meaningful insights and reports\n",
    "    - enables you to define various constraints on the data to maintain data integrity\n",
    "    - supports transaction management\n",
    "    - offers mechanism to grant and revoke priviledges on database objects\n",
