    "- growing technology which enables computers to learn from past experiences\n",
    "- AI vs machine learning\n",
    "    - machine learning is subset of AI\n",
    "        - development of algorithms and statistical models that enable learning from past experiences\n",
    "    - definition coined in the 1950s: machine learning enables machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance from experiences and predict things without being explicitly programmed\n",
    "- traditional programming vs machine learning\n",
    "    - traditional programming: data + program -> computer -> output\n",
    "    - machine learning: data + output -> computer -> program\n",
    "- classifications of machine learning\n",

    "    - unsupervised learning\n",
    "    - reinforcement learning\n",
    "- regression vs classification\n",
    "    - regression: uses machine learning algorithms to learn continuous mapping function\n",
    "    - classification: algorithms want to learn discrete mapping function\n",
    "- types of unsupervised learning\n",
    "    - dimensionality reduction: reduces number of dimensions from high to low while retaining critical data\n",
    "    - no labeled data\n",
    "- reinforcement learning: feedback learning method\n",
    "    - right action gets a reward\n",
    "    - wrong action gets a penalty\n",
    "- batch vs onlien learning: based on production\n",
    "    - batch (offline, then deployed): system cannot learn incrementally\n",
    "        - batches of data\n",
    "    - online learning: training happens incrementally as data arrives\n",
    "        - good option if you have limited computer resources\n",
    "- instance-based vs model-based learning\n",
    "    - instance-based: involves memorizing training data\n",
    "    - model-based: constructs models from training data\n",
    "- machine learning process: data collection -> data exploration -> data preparation -> modeling -> evaluation (circles back to modeling, iterate to find best model)\n",
    "    - 80% of the time is usually spent in data collection, data exploration, data preparation stages\n",
    "    - steps\n",
